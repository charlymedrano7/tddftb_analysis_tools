The STO.dat file must to be done by hand based on the respective wfc.hsd file

- The 'STO.pbc_EXAMPLE.dat' file is based on the waveplot file 'wfc.pbc-0-3.hsd'

The flags <Pump> and <PumpProbeFrames> must to be added to the ElectronDynamics{} block
in the dftb_in.hsd file to dump the time-evolving density matrix to a 
binary file every given number of steps (*ppdump.bin files)

- The user has to edit some variables inside the density_on_grid_timeprop_dftb.py
